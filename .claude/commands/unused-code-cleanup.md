## Task Instructions

1. **Verification Phase**
   - For each file listed above, perform thorough analysis:
     - Search for dynamic imports (e.g., `import()`, `require()`)
     - Check for string-based references
     - Look for configuration-based usage
     - Verify no test files depend on these components

2. **Cleanup Phase**
   - Only delete files that are confirmed unused after verification
   - Create a backup/report of deleted files
   - Update any related documentation or comments

3. **Report Generation**
   - Create a markdown report in `docs/unused/cleanup-report.md` containing:
     - List of deleted files
     - List of files kept (with justification)
     - Total cleanup impact (files/lines removed)

## Statistics

- Total files analyzed: 60
- Total exports: 72
- Unused exports: 9

## Safety Guidelines

- **DO NOT** delete files that have ANY uncertainty
- **DO** create a git commit with all deletions for easy rollback
- **DO** run the build and tests after cleanup
- **DO** verify the application still functions correctly
